    - parent folderId from URL params
        - "/home" = null (root folder)
- Folders
    - create/rename/delete
    - parent folderId from URL params
        - "/home" = null (root folder)
    - go into folder
        - URL change, parentId

Optimization (minimize APIs and re-rendering)
- Callback approach (siblings and children -> parent)
    - on creation/deletion of file/folder, pass argument into sibling/parent component
        - trigger storage update
- rename file/folder only renders corresponding FileList/FolderList
    - ModalContext (two rename modals for all files and folders)
- Memoization
- 


User Interface
- Loading messages/screens/design
- Error messages
- Status 500 page
- Modal Design


Nice to Haves
